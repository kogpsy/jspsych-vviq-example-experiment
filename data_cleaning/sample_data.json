Marked individual\n    differences are found in the strength and clarity of reported visual imagery\n    and these differences are of considerable psychological interest.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The aim of this test is to determine the vividness of your visual imagery.\n    The items of the test will possibly bring certain images to your mind. You\n    are asked to rate the vividness of each image by reference to the five-point\n    scale given below.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If you do not have a visual image, rate vividness as '1'. If your images are\n    truly as lively and vivid as real seeing, rate vividness as '5'.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Throughout the test, refer to the rating scale when judging the vividness of\n    each image. Try to do each item separately, independent of how you may have\n    done other items.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Please note that there are no right or wrong answers to the questions, and\n    that it is not necessarily desirable to experience imagery or, if you do, to\n    have more vivid imagery.\n  </p>\n  <p>If you are ready, press <strong>[ space ]</strong> to start.</p>\n</div>\n","response":" ","trial_type":"html-keyboard-response","trial_index":1,"time_elapsed":12915,"internal_node_id":"0.0-1.0-0.0","participant_id":"testSubj123"},{"rt":6979,"response":{"B1Q1":2,"B1Q2":0,"B1Q3":3,"B1Q4":0},"question_order":[0,1,2,3],"trial_type":"survey-likert","trial_index":2,"time_elapsed":19902,"internal_node_id":"0.0-1.0-1.0","participant_id":"testSubj123"},{"rt":5072,"response":{"B2Q1":1,"B2Q2":3,"B2Q3":4,"B2Q4":1},"question_order":[0,1,2,3],"trial_type":"survey-likert","trial_index":3,"time_elapsed":24979,"internal_node_id":"0.0-1.0-2.0","participant_id":"testSubj123"},{"rt":4760,"response":{"B3Q1":1,"B3Q2":3,"B3Q3":1,"B3Q4":0},"question_order":[0,1,2,3],"trial_type":"survey-likert","trial_index":4,"time_elapsed":29747,"internal_node_id":"0.0-1.0-3.0","participant_id":"testSubj123"},{"rt":5456,"response":{"B4Q1":4,"B4Q2":2,"B4Q3":1,"B4Q4":3},"question_order":[0,1,2,3],"trial_type":"survey-likert","trial_index":5,"time_elapsed":35212,"internal_node_id":"0.0-1.0-4.0","participant_id":"testSubj123"},{"rt":4852,"response":{"B5Q1":1,"B5Q2":3,"B5Q3":1,"B5Q4":1},"question_order":[0,1,2,3],"trial_type":"survey-likert","trial_index":6,"time_elapsed":40070,"internal_node_id":"0.0-1.0-5.0","participant_id":"testSubj123"},{"rt":4667,"response":{"B6Q1":3,"B6Q2":3,"B6Q3":2,"B6Q4":3},"question_order":[0,1,2,3],"trial_type":"survey-likert","trial_index":7,"time_elapsed":44744,"internal_node_id":"0.0-1.0-6.0","participant_id":"testSubj123"},{"rt":9071,"response":{"B7Q1":4,"B7Q2":2,"B7Q3":3,"B7Q4":2},"question_order":[0,1,2,3],"trial_type":"survey-likert","trial_index":8,"time_elapsed":53824,"internal_node_id":"0.0-1.0-7.0","participant_id":"testSubj123"},{"rt":6204,"response":{"B8Q1":1,"B8Q2":3,"B8Q3":4,"B8Q4":1},"question_order":[0,1,2,3],"trial_type":"survey-likert","trial_index":9,"time_elapsed":60035,"internal_node_id":"0.0-1.0-8.0","participant_id":"testSubj123"}]
